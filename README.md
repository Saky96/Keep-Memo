# Keep-Memo
It is my training project which i made during my 6 weeks training in android development.
Keep memo lets u do the following:
1.It lets you create short notes/memos of about 140 characters.
2.Memos are stored on local sqlite database.
3.Memos can be categorized as normal, important or urgent.
4.Urgent memos are elligible for the alerts.
5.Alerts can be added to urgent memos using date and time pickers.
6.User can edit as well as delete the memos.
